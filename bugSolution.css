The solution involves being more explicit in our CSS selectors to remove any ambiguity. We ensure that the highest specificity selector takes precedence:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

#myID div {
  color: green;
}

/*  Solution: add more specific rule*/
#myID .myClass div {
  color: purple;
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the `purple` color is applied consistently across browsers, resolving the unexpected rendering behavior.
